The servicing issue is bad service centers don't listen to your problem tata should work on servicing. Overall maintenance is good and not very expensive\nPros: good looking, five-star safety rating, value for money in the segment, good performance\nCons: mileage is very low in cities 12 to 13 and highways 17 to 18\nBad service experience if you have any problem in your car they don't talk to politely and don't solve your problem even if you complain on the Tata helpline they won't make any difference, \n3 3-cylinder engine should come with a four-cylinder engine",
